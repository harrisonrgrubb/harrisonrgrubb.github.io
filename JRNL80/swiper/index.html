 <p>Police in Nassau County are on high alert after MS-13 made multiple threats against law enforcement. <a href="https://www.newsday.com/long-island/crime/ms13-threaten-police-1.18155522" target="_blank">According to top police officials</a>, the gang threatened to take back the streets and execute police officers.</p>

 <p>The threats came after a high ranking MS-13 member was arraigned in Nassau County. According to a <a href="http://www.nassauda.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1008" target="_blank">press release</a> from the county, Miguel Angel Corea Diaz is the most powerful gang member on the East Coast, and is charged with ordering murders and trafficking narcotics.</p>

  <p>Following the threat, former NYPD officer and Long Island resident Peter Markey said he would discontinue wearing police apparel, "I can't wear my police stuff in public, they [MS-13] could be anywhere."</p>

  <p>Markey says police officers need to be vigilant and aware of their surroudnings. "Avoid areas that you believe should be avoided and use a different routine to get home." The retired cop says gang members could try to follow law enforcement to their houses in order to threaten their families.</p>

 <p>Patrick Young, the Program Director at Central American Refugee Center on Long Island, thinks it’s understandable for law enforcement to take precautions but thinks the likelihood of an attack is small. Young believes the police have actually made the situation worse. He says the police are overwhelmingly white and don’t have much contact with the Latino community apart from stressful situations. “They don’t always know the people in the Latino community outside of the perps,” said Young.</p>

  <p>Young believes Latinos have been mistreated by law enforcement and Long Island Officials. “Victims are being marginalized by officials. There’s no helping hand reaching out,” said Young. He thinks that the Latino immigrant community has been stigmatized and that President Trump’s rhetoric isn’t helping.</p>
